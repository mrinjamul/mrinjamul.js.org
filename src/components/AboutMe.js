            Hey! I'm <strong>Injamul Mohammad Mollah</strong> . 
            Coding has changed my world. 
            Learning to code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i> and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. 
            I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. 
            And I learned it all at <strong>SoloLearn</strong> where they build your self-esteem and keep you motivated.
            Join me in this rewarding journey. 
            You'll have fun, get help, and learn along the way!
        </p>
